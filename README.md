# Arrayality intro
    A logical game JavaScript (open source) powered & light-weight

# Gameplay
 Compose the numbers in the array to get the highest score in the fewest moves. <br>
 The score is calculated by multiplying a series of the same numbers. <br>
 Units shall be next to each other, deuces through one, three through two, and so on.

# Scores
  Arrays generated randomly (with a low starting score), so the maximum score is a kind of question. <br>
  A typical score (for 16x board) is `192` while `216` and `256` is usually possible. <br>
  The score `288` perfect for the most sets, rarely `340` also possible. <br>
  The theoretical maximum score has no proof at this time.
