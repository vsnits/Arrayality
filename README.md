# Arrayality intro
  A logical game JavaScript powered & light-weight

# Gameplay
  Swap the numbers in the array to get the highest score in the fewest moves. <br>
  The score is calculated by multiplying a series of the same numbers. <br>
  Units shall be next to each other, deuces through one, three through two, and so on.

# Scores
  Arrays generated randomly (with a low starting score), so the maximum score is a kind of question.
  A typical result score is `192` while `216` and `256` is usually possible.
  The score `288` perfect for the most sets, rarely `340` also possible.
  The theoretical maximum score has no proof for this time.
